## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

Previously, I was knowledgeable of both linear and radial gradients and their respective usage in CSS. Although I am not completely comfortable with using radial gradients, I wish to use them more in my upcoming personal projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Gradient Generator](https://www.cssportal.com/css-gradient-generator/) - This site helped me grasp the concept on radial gradients and allowed for me to practice different techniques while creating them.
